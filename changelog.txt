1.00
Site was brung upon Github, where I fiddled with the CSS and got a working navbar.
-1.5
Content added to the non-CSS site, which should be imported to the 1.00 site once I am able to grab the documents.
Real 1.5
Coming to the Github repo soon, it should combine both 1.00 and -1.5 together.
-------------------FUTURE UPDATES----------------------
2.0
PHP and CSS added and improved respectibly.
